# Machine Learning Engineer Reporting for Duty

M.Sc. Informatics student at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), working at the intersection of **machine learning, robotics, and scientific computing**.  
My research revolves around **3D perception, multimodality, and physics-informed learning** — spanning autonomous driving, space applications, and computer vision.
